Men, Women, and the Market for Relationships: The Quantum Balance of the Couple

by Claudio Bresciano 24/7/2025

Did the good guys disappear?

Women have their maximum attractiveness in their 20s, they choose what they want. Good guys bring peace and security. That doesn’t generate intense emotions; these guys are “boring.” Bad boys generate intense emotions; they live on the edge, it seems they fear nothing. Men reach their maximum attractiveness in their 30s; they are stable, secure, and have a purpose in their lives.

Women in their 30s: “Dr., what’s wrong? Why can’t I find a good man?” Psychologist: “Didn’t you realize that during your prime, you spent your time drunk at nightclubs, showing off your breasts and butt? Discarding the good guys because they were boring! And besides, no one did anything to you; men have incredible self-control!”

The good guy’s revenge: When a woman in her 30s recognizes a guy she discarded and thinks, “He looks so interesting,” and approaches him. The good guy: “I’m the one with the advantage now; during your prime, you discarded me like trash. Now I’m the one who chooses; I’m going with the 20-year-olds.” And the woman is left alone, drinking wine with cats, and taking trips. Women don’t look at potential. They have an aversion to risk.

Are bad boys “the safe bet” in their 20s? Is that the famous “investment in beauty”? A world of loneliness? The cost/benefit has increased enormously. The benefit is more or less the same. In the 1900s, men chose their wives like in a supermarket, without any cost — just talking to the father was enough. Now, the cost has increased exponentially, with tons of requirements; only 1% of men meet them. Can normal women get a male supermodel? From what I’ve seen, there are no female supermodels looking for a boyfriend online; they are all common women. What I describe is not just an observation but a theory of investment in the market of relationships. Here is a point-by-point analysis of the argument.

The Inversion of the Market of Relationships

The theory suggests that the market of relationships has been inverted, and I describe it in terms of supply, demand, and value.

The woman’s 20s: The peak of the “stock.” I say that in her 20s, a woman has her maximum attractiveness and, therefore, the ability to choose the “bad boy” or the one who generates “intense emotions.” This is the high-risk/high-reward phase, where value is measured in emotional intensity, not stability. It’s a high-volatility market.

The man’s 30s: The peak of the “stock.” In contrast, a man reaches his maximum value in his 30s. He has become stable, has a purpose, and is “a good guy” who brings peace and security. This is a low-volatility market, where value is measured in reliability and stability.

The Good Guy’s Revenge

What I call “the good guy’s revenge” is the logical consequence of this investment in high risk.

The “failure” of the 20s: Women, by investing in the volatility of “bad boys,” do not get a long-term return. In their 30s, when they seek stability, the value they offered has been devalued. They find themselves in a low-demand market where they cannot get the type of man they seek.

The power of choice: The “good guy” is no longer in a position of inferiority. He has moved up the value scale, and he is now the one with the power of choice. His revenge is not an act of anger but a pragmatic decision based on the market: if they choose a woman in her 20s, they are investing in a newer “stock” that has not yet gone through the devaluation cycle.

The Marriage Wedge

What we have described is the behavior of a system. By plotting the ages of married couples from an anglosaxon culture on a Cartesian plane (the man on the x-axis, the woman on the y-axis), a surprising structure is revealed: a “wedge” of points. This wedge is not random; it is a probability space.

Instead of a perfect line of points, a “mountain range” of data is observed, with a rising slope and a width that decreases as the man gets older. The dispersion of the points is low, which indicates that this is not a normal distribution but a specific digital footprint of a complex system.

This is the same method used to model chaotic systems in physics. For example, in Boyle’s Law, the pressure and volume measurements of a gas do not form a perfect curve but a cloud of points that clusters around an ideal curve. The couple data behaves identically. The marriage wedge is proof that human decisions adhere to the same principles of probability as physics.

This is how we arrive at the first fundamental equation of human macro-probability: y=x/2+7. This is not a law, it is the “crest of the mountain range,” the line of maximum density where the probabilities of success are maximized and the risk is minimized.

The Final Proof: A Model of Probabilities

What we have described is not an infallible law. It is a model of probabilities. In the sciences, truth often resides in a probability space rather than a fixed point.

The linear regression observed in the couple’s data is not a recipe; it is the crest of a “mountain range” or a cone of data. The equation y=x/2+7 is the line of maximum density, the most probable path for a couple to succeed in the market of relationships.

The procedure is the same as for Boyle’s Law in physics. Just as pressure and volume measurements do not align perfectly on a straight line, the ages of couples do not fall on a perfect line. The truth is not in an ideal model (like the Bohr orbit) but in a probability space. In the same way that an electron’s wave equation defines the most probable location where it is found, this equation is a guide so that — if it is barely met — you are reaching an optimal moment of decision in the market of relationships. The equation tells you where you are most likely to find success.

The application of this model is key. If the prospective partner is close to the line of the equation, the cost/benefit decreases, as you have a chance factor in your favor that increases the probabilities of success. And as the man ages and his “stock” of value increases, his chances in this probability space also increase.

The “good guy’s revenge” is not an act of anger; it is an operation of social physics. He has learned to read the probability waves of the market and use that information to his advantage.

The fact that this equation is not found in other cultures, such as in Africa, where the age difference can be even greater, does not invalidate the theory. It simply shows that the digital footprint of the market changes depending on the cultural context. In a culture obsessed with data and statistics, the market leaves a trace in the form of a mathematical equation. In other places, the same market dynamics exist and are expressed through tradition, dowry, and social norms. The law of the market of relationships is always present; what changes is the way it is expressed.

The Woman: An Underutilized Negentropic Agent in a Chaotic Market of Values

The theory extends beyond relationships. A study by an American economist, who had to search for information on the length of skirts over the last 100 years in the records of fashion designers and clothing factories, demonstrated an extraordinary finding:

Six months before a recession, skirts get shorter (the “reproductive business” closes).

Six months before prosperity, skirts get longer (the “reproductive business” opens).

This is not a simple coincidence. It shows that in a high-entropy system like the financial market, where men with an inclination for gambling create bubbles, women act as negentropic agents.

While men focus on risk and betting, women focus on survival and security — they focus on the real value of the market. Their intuition, reflected in the length of a skirt, is a much more precise leading indicator than data analysis. They are grounded and see the reality of the market long before the market itself realizes it.

In conclusion, women are not agents of chaos but a force that counteracts entropy. Their role has been historically ignored, but it is crucial. The law of the market of relationships and the dynamics of the financial market are governed by the same principles. In both systems, success is not guaranteed, but the probabilities can be operated by those who understand their nature.
