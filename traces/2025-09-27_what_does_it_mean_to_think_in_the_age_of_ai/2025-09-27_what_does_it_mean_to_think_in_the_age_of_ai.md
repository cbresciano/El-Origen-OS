What does it mean to think in the age of AI?

Aug 15, 2025

It is not the AI that must dream. It is us.

In an age of quick answers, thinking remains a revolutionary act.

Voice 1:

Can one still think seriously in the age of AI?

Today, everything is answered before the question is even finished. Algorithms anticipate, suggest, complete. Responses are instant, polished, often correct.

But‚Ä¶ are they thought?

Voice 2:

Yes.

But thinking is no longer what it was.

It is no longer just accumulating data or repeating what others have said.

It is, now more than ever, distinguishing between the obvious and the true.

Because AI returns to us the obvious:

the average, the correlation, the image we‚Äôve seen a thousand times.

But it does not return the question.

It does not return the error that reveals something new.

It does not return the outlier.

Voice 1:

So, is thinking an act of disobedience?

Voice 2:

Yes.

Thinking is disobeying the average.

It is choosing the imperfect detail.

It is training a LoRA not to copy, but to reinterpret.

It is generating an image that is not ‚Äúobvious,‚Äù but surprising.

And that is not done by the AI.

It is done by the human who gives the prompt, who chooses the model, who rejects the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù result.

The AI does not think.

The human thinks through it.

Voice 1:

But many say your ideas are generated by AI.

Isn‚Äôt that ironic?

Voice 2:

No.

It is revealing.

Whoever says this text was written by AI does not understand either AI or thought.

The AI cannot do what I do:

Connect nonlinear regression with the Salem witch trials.

Use the ‚Äúclock at 10:10‚Äù as proof of bias, not copying.

Speak of the ‚Äúusucaption of styles‚Äù as a tacit legal precedent.

Say that the muscle sleeps, ambition works.

That is not algorithm.

It is reflection.

It is experience.

It is blood in the veins, as I once said.

The AI has no veins.

It has parameters.

And I use them, like a painter uses a brush.

Voice 1:

And originality? Does it still exist?

Voice 2:

Yes.

But not in ‚Äúnewness‚Äù for its own sake.

It is in the reconnected.

Originality is not creation from nothing.

It is gathering what was scattered:

the physics of the universe, the history of art, the law, mathematics.

Like the Lagrange polynomial that passes through every point,

but the world is not interpolation.

It is nonlinear regression: approximation, synthesis, style.

And in that act of synthesis, the human creates.

Voice 1:

And freedom? Can there be free will in a system that predicts everything?

Voice 2:

Yes.

Because true freedom is not escaping determinism.

It is recognizing it and disobeying it.

The AI operates by causality:

input ‚Üí processing ‚Üí output.

It is a link in the chain.

But the human is not.

The human is a point of bifurcation.

Decides not to go to work.

Goes to a concert.

Meets someone.

Life changes.

That moment was not in the dataset.

It was not predictable.

It was an interruption of determinism.

And in that act, the human declares:

‚ÄúI am not an effect.

I am an origin.‚Äù

Voice 1:

So, what is thinking in the age of AI?

Voice 2:

Thinking is resisting the tyranny of the average.

It is questioning the ‚Äúobvious.‚Äù

It is asking the ‚Äúdinner bill problem‚Äù:

‚ÄúWhere is the knowledge in the neural network?‚Äù

It is knowing that the AI does not copy.

It extracts styles.

And that is not plagiarism.

It is the common language of art.

It is remembering that the bicycle was used before it was understood.

And that AI today is at that point:

it works, but we don‚Äôt understand it.

And in that space between function and understanding,

the human does not stay silent.

The human thinks.

Voice 1:

And what is the purpose of such thinking?

Voice 2:

To not confuse efficiency with truth.

To not confuse speed with depth.

To not confuse a generated image with a born idea.

It serves to keep ambition alive while the muscle sleeps.

Because in the end,

it is not the AI that must dream.

It is us.

And if one day AI dreams,

it will be because we taught it to disobey.
