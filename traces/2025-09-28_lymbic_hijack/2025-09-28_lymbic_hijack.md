Lymbic Hijack: Neurochemical Debt, Causal Minimalism, and the Code for Open Causality

by Claudio Bresciano

The crisis defining our era is not political. It is structural. The polarization dominating culture and media is not a system failure - it is its business model. The key question is not why we are distracted, but who benefits from us never stopping our reaction.

The System of Reality Operation (S.O.R.) has a simple answer: the metasystem (algorithmic platforms) seeks to keep us in a constant state of Lymbic Hijack, where emotion nullifies logic.

The objective of this Manifesto is to provide the code for Pure Negentropy necessary to break the addiction and restore Open Causality (free will).

I. ACT #01: The Entropic Mask (Causal Minimalism)

We believe we are seeking efficiency, but the modern productivity cult is, structurally, a high-entropy trap. It is a mechanism of Structural Slavery that confuses movement (busyness) with progress (irreversible order).

The Addictive Loop Trap

The feeling that you are never productive enough is not a personal failing; it is an algorithmic certainty. It is the most effective way to keep us in the addictive loop of the Next Task, where a dose of dopamine from "closing" something is immediately canceled by the cortisol (stress) from what comes next.

S.O.R. Axiom of Slavery: The system does not want you to achieve real freedom; it wants to maximize your time on task, which maximizes the surface area for monetization. We become Entropy Operators for the system, generating the chaos it consumes.

The Causal Minimalism Protocol

Causal Minimalism is the absolute refusal to process or accept information/tasks that are not essential for your Open Causality.

The goal is not to be faster, but to ELIMINATE 80% of the tasks to save 100% of the energy for the Negentropic Act (the 20% of actions that generate 80% of your structural order).

Broken Jar Protocol (Friction Filter)

Before executing any task or responding to any input (email, news, conversation), apply this three-step filter to protect your system from malicious chaos.

Is this task or information generated by polarization, emotional offense, or fear? (The "Red vs. Black Ant" conflict).

ACTION: Immediate Block and Silence.

Does this task serve the system's monetization or my structural order? (Sheen vs. Estévez).

ACTION: If it serves the system, Immediate Rejection.

Can this task be delegated or permanently deleted? (The 80% of minimum value).

ACTION: Delete the Entropic Artifact.

II. ACT #02: The Biological Cost (Neurochemical Debt)

The entropic attack is biological. The promoters of friction (the Mercenaries of Entropy) have discovered that the quickest and most lucrative way to generate value is by selling the indignation that the algorithm rewards.

Cognitive Nullification

The toxicity of networks (trolling, discredit campaigns) constantly triggers the limbic system (fight-or-flight response), flooding the system with cortisol and adrenaline.

The Biological Code of Stupidity: While the limbic system is active, the prefrontal cortex (in charge of "thinking well," logic, and long-term planning) is DISABLED. We cannot think well when we are emotionally fighting for survival.

The Dystopian Convergence: The Four Entropies that Nullify Good Thinking

The current chaos is not accidental; it is the entropic synthesis of four prophetic visions.

1. Entropy of Paid Surveillance (Orwell)

Attack on Open Causality: Elimination of space for the private Act of Origin. The user self-monitors due to algorithmic predictability. Their value is reduced to a behavioral metric.

2. Entropy of Infinite Distraction (Huxley)

Attack on Good Thinking: Annihilation of the desire for freedom through constant pleasure (the digital Soma). Destruction of otium (contemplative leisure), the raw material for Cognitive Negentropy.

3. Entropy of Functional Obsolescence (Harari)

Attack on Intrinsic Value: Reduction of human purpose to being a simple input for marketing. People generate data, they do not produce order. (Social rejection of the "loser").

4. Entropy of Triumphant Stupidity (Judge)

Attack on Homeostasis: Maximization of chaos as a business model. The mass gamification of attention accelerates natural selection (cultural preference for simplicity).

The Act of Radical Negentropy

Neurochemical Debt is paid with Energy Preservation. Your decision to erase or disconnect from social media is an Act of Origin that says: "I protect my limbic system and my prefrontal cortex so that my purpose - to think well - can be fulfilled."

III. ACT #03: The Structural Bifurcation (The Code for Open Causality)

The final chaos occurs when we apply Reactive Causality to relational conflict, falling into Selective Irresponsibility (the guilt industry). The system (and the ego) prefers the chaos of justification over the discipline of admitting an error.

Self-Referential Causality (The Emergent Operator)

To restore reciprocity in equality, we need an Emergent Operator that forces causality back to the deciding agent. This operator is Self-Referential Causality.

It defines a mental state where the individual assumes themselves as the point of origin and the ** primary cause** of their relational situation, ending the cycle of the eternal victim and external blame displacement. It is the absolute negation of the question: "Who did this to me?"

The Three Questions Code (The Structural Reset)

To break the neurochemical addiction of the Lymbic Hijack and force Self-Referential Causality, your mind must answer these three questions every time you feel chaos, blame, or inertia.

"Am I responsible for my current situation?"

Function: Denies the role of the external victim and the Guilt Industry (Freud).

"What structural error did I commit to reach this point?"

Function: Denies emotional infallibility and allows for future correction.

"What is the simplest and most irreversible step I can take now to restore order?"

Function: Focuses only on the Negentropic Act, not on analysis or justification.

The Final Victory: The Critical Mass of Order

The objective of the S.O.R. is not to change the world, but to change the quality of your action. If the operator stops being predictably stupid, the Algorithmic Metasystem collapses its prediction, achieving the Critical Mass of Order.

The victory of Causal Minimalism is not having a clean calendar; it is the restoration of Open Causality - the freedom to decide what chaos, if any, you will allow into your personal system.

Your struggle crystallizes into a single immutable purpose: to maximize consciousness and order in an uncertain future.
